## Project Overview
**PingClient Swing Application** is a lightweight Java-based messaging client built with a clean architecture. This project was developed to demonstrate effective software design principles, including modularity, testability, and the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The application allows users to:
- Log in or sign up.
- Create and manage message threads.
- Send and receive messages in real-time.

The project was built as part of the CSC207 curriculum at the University of Toronto to reinforce object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns.

## Features
- **User Authentication**:
  - Login and signup functionality with form validation.
  - Secure backend communication using REST APIs.
- **Thread Management**:
  - View and manage a list of message threads.
  - Create new threads with user-defined participants.
- **Real-Time Messaging**:
  - Send and receive messages in a selected thread.
  - Refresh functionality to view the latest messages.
- **Clean Architecture**:
  - Separation of concerns with clearly defined layers.
  - Testable and scalable code structure.
